## Overview

I had fun making this even though I am pretty sure I could use some coaching on best practices.  I can tell it isn't perfect even though it is very close.  Since I only had a static image to work with and nothing else I feel happy with how it turned out, feel free to give me feedback and notes on how it could improve!

## My process

The process here is pretty straighforward.

-I wrote out the HTML in as simple of a way as possible since there was only really one asset and some text.
-Then, I created my class names and made sure I had everything I needed imported as far as fonts and colors (those were provided for us as well) and began writing out the CSS.
-Normally I would have started with mobile-first design but since this was such a simple layout I didn't think it would really matter which way we went first, just thought I would note that in case it matters and if its best practice to always start with mobile-first please feel free to let me know! 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS

### What I learned

I realized that you need to constantly practice this stuff because even simple things are difficult if you don't do it all the time.  Gotta cement these basic things in, I'm glad I am doing these simple little projects!
